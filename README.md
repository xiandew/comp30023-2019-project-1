## Introduction

This is a multi-user server which serves the game "Image Tagger". Users will be randomly paired up once they are ready to get started. Each pair of users are given the same image and the intention is that users should submit keywords that describe the images, one each time preferably, and the users will win the game if both submit the same word.
